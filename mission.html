    <h1>Importance of Self Care</h1>
    <p>
        Today, mental challenges have become more prominent within society and, each day, less stigmatized. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed
        to an even greater mental health crisis that we as a community are continuing to acknowledge and recover from. Over 1 in 5 individuals
        from the age of 13 to 18 have, either currently or at some point in their life, dealt with mental health illnesses or challenges. The daily pressures
        of school and work environments, not to mention personal or home situations, all contribute to declining mental wellbeing. As such, taking 
        care of ourselves and promoting self-love has never been more important. Even small acts of self-care can improve a person's daily mood, and it is
        important that we acknowledge and do our best to take care of ourselves.
    </p>


    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>Our mission is to provide a one-stop-shop for all your mental health needs. With our three categories, there is something for everyone. We hope
        people can use this website to destress, focus, and get inspired for whatever goals they are working on.
    </p>

    <p> Life can be stressful, and it is okay to feel overwhelmed. With our Calm tab, we want to provide ways for people to destress and regain a sense of peace. On the Breathing Bubble page,
        people can breath along with the bubble, helping them take the time they need to focus on themselves. On the Inspiring Quotes page, people can scroll through a series of motivational
        and inspirational quotes. These words of wisdom can help people feel motivated to work towards their goals or feel better about themselves.
    </p>


    <p>
        Being able to focus on a task is important for all types of people, whether they need to complete a task for their job or study for an exam. With our Study tab,
        people can find two different ways to stay focused on their work. With the Lofi Music page, people can choose from different backgrounds that have their own vibe and music.
        On the Pomodoro Timer page, people can work in silence and time themselves while they work, making sure to take breaks to relax.
    </p>


    <p>
        Inspiration comes in many forms, and our Dream tab offers a fun way to get inspired and learn more about yourself. Take our fun Color Quiz, which helps you choose which color is your aesthetic,
        then view your Photo Gallery to get personalized inspiration. As aesthetics have become a more popular trend amongst kids and young adults, it has become 
        an exciting way to inspire people to become their best selves.
    </p>
    

    <p>
        Life is not perfect. It can be messy and chaotic and things do not always go to plan. Even through it all, it is important for people to take time for themselves and to focus on
        their own mental wellness. With this website, we hope to provide people with the tools and resources they need to take control of their own lives and remind everyone that their wellbeing is important.
